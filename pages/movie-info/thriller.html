          Final Destination is a 2000 American supernatural horror film directed
          by James Wong, with a screenplay written by Wong, Glen Morgan, and
          Jeffrey Reddick, based on a story by Reddick. It is the first
          installment in the Final Destination film series and stars Devon Sawa,
          Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, and Tony Todd. Sawa portrays a teenager who
          cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane
          explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the
          explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who were
          meant to die on the plane. The film began as a spec script written by
          Reddick for an episode of The X-Files in order for Reddick to get a TV
          agent. A colleague at New Line Cinema persuaded Reddick to write it as
          a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, The X-Files writing
          partners, became interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and
          direct the film, marking Wong's film directing debut. Filming took
          place in New York City and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in
          Toronto and San Francisco. It was released on March 17, 2000, and
          became a financial success, making $10 million on its opening weekend.

          box office success, grossing $95 million worldwide against its $3.5
          million production budget.
