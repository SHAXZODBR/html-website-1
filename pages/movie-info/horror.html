          The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by
          James Wan and written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. It is the
          inaugural film in The Conjuring Universe franchise.[4] Patrick Wilson
          and Vera Farmiga star as Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal
          investigators and authors associated with prominent cases of haunting.
          Their purportedly real-life reports inspired The Amityville Horror
          story and film franchise.[5] The Warrens come to the assistance of the
          Perron family, who experienced increasingly disturbing events in their
          newly occupied farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. Development of the
          film began in January 2012, and reports confirmed Wan as the director
          of a film entitled The Warren Files, later retitled The Conjuring.
          Production commenced in Wilmington, North Carolina, in February 2012,
          and scenes were shot in chronological order. The Conjuring was
          released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, by Warner
          Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It received positive reviews from
          critics, who praised the performances, direction, screenplay,
          atmosphere, and musical score. It grossed over $319 million worldwide
          against its $20 million budget. A sequel, The Conjuring 2, was
          released in 2016.
