          The Boys is an American satirical superhero television series
          developed by Eric Kripke for Amazon Prime Video. Based on the comic
          book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, it follows
          the eponymous team of vigilantes as they combat superpowered
          individuals who abuse their powers. The series features an ensemble
          cast that includes Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin
          Moriarty, Dominique McElligott, Jessie T. Usher, Chace Crawford, Laz
          Alonso, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, and Nathan Mitchell. Originally
          intended to be a feature-length film, the comic book series adaptation
          began its development in 2008 with Adam McKay set to direct the film.
          Due to creative differences between the crew and the studios that
          picked up the film, the project was left in development hell. The
          development for the project was revived in 2016 by Cinemax, which
          announced that it would be reworked as a television series. Kripke was
          recruited to be the showrunner of the series, while Seth Rogen and
          Evan Goldberg would be the executive producers. Amazon Studios
          obtained the rights for the series in November 2017, with production
          starting in May 2018 in Toronto.
