          The Conjuring 2 (known in the United Kingdom as The Conjuring 2: The
          Enfield Case)[4][5] is a 2016 American supernatural horror film,
          directed by James Wan. The screenplay is by Chad Hayes, Carey W.
          Hayes, Wan, and David Leslie Johnson. It is the sequel to 2013's The
          Conjuring, the second installment in The Conjuring series, and the
          third installment in The Conjuring Universe franchise. Patrick Wilson
          and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as paranormal investigators and
          authors Ed and Lorraine Warren from the first film. The film follows
          the Warrens as they travel to England to assist the Hodgson family,
          who are experiencing poltergeist activity at their Enfield council
          house in 1977 which later became referred to as the Enfield
          poltergeist. In July 2013, before the release of the first film, it
          was reported that New Line Cinema was already developing a sequel with
          both Farmiga and Wilson signed on to reprise their roles. By October
          2014, it was announced that Wan would return to direct the sequel and
          would make his first contribution as a writer in the franchise.
          Principal photography began in September 2015 in Los Angeles and
          concluded in December 2015 in London.

          Black Mirror is a British anthology television series created by
          Charlie Brooker. Individual episodes explore a diversity of genres,
          but most are set in near-future dystopias with sci-fi technology—a
          type of speculative fiction. The series is inspired by The Twilight
          Zone and uses the themes of technology and media to comment on
          contemporary social issues. Most episodes are written by Brooker with
          heavy involvement by the executive producer Annabel Jones. There are
          27 episodes across six series and one special, in addition to the
          interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (2018). The first two
          series aired on the British network Channel 4 in 2011 and 2013, as did
          the 2014 special "White Christmas". The programme then moved to
          Netflix, where four further series aired in 2016, 2017, 2019, and
          2023. A seventh series is in development. Two related webisode series
          were produced by Netflix, and a companion book to the first four
          series, Inside Black Mirror, was published in 2018. Soundtracks to
          many episodes have been released as albums.

          Teenage vampire Juliette Fairmont, having celebrated her sixteenth
          birthday, needs to make her first kill in order to enter adulthood and
          take her place among her powerful family of Legacy vampires,
          matrilineal direct descendants of Lilith who chose to be bitten by the
          Serpent in the Garden of Eden. Juliette has difficulty choosing
          someone to feed on and struggles with her growing blood lust as she
          believes draining humans is wrong. She instead sets her sights
          romantically on the new girl Calliope Burns. Calliope, who belongs to
          a monster-hunting family from The Guardian Guild, needs to slay her
          first monster in order to gain her family's approval and officially
          become a Hunter herself. As both families become unavoidably involved,
          and Juliette and Calliope's relationship develops, the girls realize
          that killing each other is not so simple.

          The first season of Supernatural, an American dark fantasy television
          series created by Eric Kripke, premiered on September 13, 2005, and
          concluded on May 4, 2006, after 22 episodes. It focuses on brothers
          Sam and Dean Winchester as they track down their father, John, who is
          on the trail of the demon who killed their mother and Sam's
          girlfriend. During their travels, they use their father's journal to
          help them carry on the family business—saving people and hunting
          supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles star as Sam
          and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring as their father, John,
          and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only season to
          air on The WB, with all subsequent seasons airing on The CW, a joint
          venture of The WB and UPN.[1] As of 2019, Supernatural is also the
          only continuing series that originated on The WB, and by far the
          longest running show ever to have aired on that network with over 300
          episodes produced.
