          Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, [la ˈkasa ðe paˈpel],
          lit. 'The House of Paper') is a Spanish heist crime drama television
          series created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared
          heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of
          Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one
          of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The story is told in a
          real-time-like fashion and relies on an unreliable narrator,
          flashbacks, time-jumps and hidden character motivations for
          complexity.[2][3][4] The series was initially intended as a limited
          series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes
          on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017.
          Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the
          series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning
          with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part
          on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a
          significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with
          eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight
          episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the
          producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money
          Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fenómeno). In
          July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which
          was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December
          2021, respectively.

          The first season of the fantasy drama television series Game of
          Thrones premiered on HBO on April 17, 2011, in the U.S. and concluded
          on June 19, 2011. It consists of ten episodes, each of approximately
          55 minutes. The series is based on A Game of Thrones, the first novel
          in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, adapted
          for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. HBO had ordered a
          television pilot in November 2008; filming began the following year.
          However, it was deemed unsatisfactory and later reshot with some roles
          recast. In March 2010, HBO ordered the first season, which began
          filming in July 2010, primarily in Belfast, Northern Ireland, with
          additional filming in Malta. The story takes place in a fantasy world,
          primarily upon the continent Westeros, with one storyline occurring on
          another continent to the east, Essos. Like the novel, the season
          initially focuses on the family of nobleman Eddard "Ned" Stark, the
          Warden of the North, who is asked to become the King's Hand (chief
          advisor) to his longtime friend, King Robert Baratheon.

          Vikings is a historical drama television series created and written by
          Michael Hirst for the History channel, a Canadian network. Filmed in
          Ireland, it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. The series
          concluded on December 30, 2020, when the second half of the sixth
          season was released in its entirety on Amazon Prime Video in Ireland,
          ahead of its broadcast on History in Canada from January 1 to March 3,

          on February 25, 2022.[1] Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Ragnar

          and notorious as the scourge of Anglo-Saxon England and West Francia.
          The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer from the Kattegat who rises to
          fame by raiding England and eventually becomes a Scandinavian king,
          with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later
          seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their
          adventures in England, Scandinavia, Kievan Rus', the Mediterranean and
          North America.

          under a deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, acquired the rights
          to release the show in the United States and around the world. In
          January 2021, it was announced that the sixth series would be the
